this is a utf-8 compatible a little shitty written xor encrypter and decrypter

you may change the encrpytion keys as you desired and tear my code down

working routine:
	xorro_encode.py 
		reads the README file and encrypts what is inside of it then creates a encoded file

	xorro_decode.py
		reads the encoded file and decodes it and prints the result


you may use many bytes to encrypt, that is your performance issue.
